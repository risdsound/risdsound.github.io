The center hosts a selection of courses where sound or music technology factors as a central medium or subject of study, offers its own educational programs, and produces events that facilitate exchange among practitioners and the public.</span></p><p>Found in 2018 as the Spatial Audio Studio and located at 15 Westminster St., SRST features an acoustically treated room with a 25.4 channel sound system, flexible seminar/work area, extensive digital composition tools, and a selection of hardware synthesizers including Serge modular and GRP. </p><p>The sound system consists of an array of 25 independently-addressable, full-range speakers in a hemisphere configuration, accompanied by 4 subwoofers. The primary way of working with the array is through audio programming languages and digital audio software. A central computer workstation joined with audio network interfaces provides connectivity throughout the room, I/O expansion, and the main interface for composition, design, and performance. A variety of spatial audio techniques are supported, including high order ambisonics, vector-based amplitude panning, multichannel surround, and 3D audio for immersive media.  In 2022-23, the Studio will complete the design and build of a Wave Field Synthesis system.</p><p>SRST provides an essential resource for curriculum and builds capacity for advanced sound studies and research engaging computation and audio technologies. The Studio supports a selection of courses offered by the interdisciplinary <a href="https://ctc.risd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computation, Technology, and Culture concentration (CTC)</a> and the graduate <a href="https://dm.risd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Digital + Media (D+M)</a>. As a workspace for projects, the Studio can be reserved by students enrolled in associated courses. As a site for research, the studio provides a hub for  faculty, staff, and student experimentation with outcomes aimed at peer review publication, presentation/performance at conferences and festivals, and other forms of exposition. Further, the studio hosts visiting lectures and workshops by designers, artists, and technologists; and provides a fresh context for exchanges with industry and cross-institutional research networks.<br><br><em>Please direct inquires to the Faculty Lead, Shawn Greenlee: sgreenle *at* risd *dot* edu</em></p><p> </p><p><br><br></p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Studio for Research in Sound and Technology, Rhode Island School of Design</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sound.risd.edu/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 240, doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://sound.risd.edu/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=abc27c3e08d71a131b1f492b23530a68"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
